# Hello, geeks! 👋

I am _Rohit Nagar_. Final-Year undergraduate at IIT Jodhpur. I am experienced developer skilled in  C, C++, Python3, JavaScript, Solidity with proficiency in C++, Python, and JavaScript. I have experience working with ReactJs, ExpressJs, Django, Truffle , Ganache and MongoDB for building applications. For machine learning and deep learning models, I use Python, along with libraries/frameworks such as TensorFlow, Numpy, and NLP. Additionally, I use C/C++ for competitive programming  on platforms like codeforces, CodeChef, and leetcode. I am constantly exploring new technologies and was particularly intrigued by blockchain and Web3 after my summer internship at **Accenture**.
